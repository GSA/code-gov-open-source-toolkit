# Issues
**Overview**
Based on some quick research in looking at best practices for labeling GitHUb issues, there is not a whole lot of documentation or guidance on the topic. The articles that are available, however, provide the following guidance:
* Labels should be consistent across repositories (except for a few language specific topics)
  * This makes switching between repositories easy and allows new team members to learn the system once, then use it everywhere
  * Label descriptions need to be clear and concise, and label descriptions and colors need to be standardized across repositories
* Labels are for both maintainers and contributors, so should provide relevant and helpful information at a glance
  * Per Dave Lunny, GitHub labels are a good thought, but they provide no context about the status of an issue, only what type of issue it is. Instead he advocates for three types of labels: status, type and priority so maintainers can know this information at a glance. 
* Labels should be as simple or complex as the project requires; labelling shouldn’t be a burden, but should be a tool
  * E.g., for smaller projects, a status label for “Completed” and “Accepted” may be the same thing - so adapt guidance as needed

**Potential Actions**
1. Identify labels to use across repositories (and if already using labels, what labels to delete)
2. Draft label descriptions in clear and concise language
3. Assign colors to labels that are standardized across repositories
