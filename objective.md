**Objective of the playbook:**
Create a resource for maintainers (and procurement?) to use when open sourcing government code, so that the OSS that is released is actually (re)usable and provides more value back to the government.
Keep it short
Use checklists
Share resources

Big steps for open sourcing:
* Securely develop in the open
* Grow your community
* Maintain the project

Resources to pull from:
* Case studies on well maintained projects? Is this what Spotlight Stories is?
* Start up a working group to participate in the creation of this work and give feedback.

The table of contents below outlines the high level topic areas that we initially identified for inclusion within the open source playbook (and can be edited, as needed). Within each topic area, we have conducted some light research to outline current practices and how other projects are tackling some of these areas within the open source community (but they still need to be addressed from the federal perspective). The last section within each topic area lists the resources that were consulted during research.
