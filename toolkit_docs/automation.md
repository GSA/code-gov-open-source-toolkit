# Automation

**What could be automated**
* Set up automatic tests that will run on all incoming contributions, and ensure that your tests can be easily be run locally by contributors
* Require that all code contributions pass your tests before they can be submitted (required status checks)
* If tests are added, make sure to explain how they work in the Contributing file
Don’t make standards too complicated or that they increase barriers to contribution – should relieve developers of repetitive, low brain power work

**Maintenance work**
* [Semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) automates releases
* [mention-bot](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot) mentions potential reviewers for pull requests
* [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) helps automate code review
* [Issue templates and pull request templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
* Style guides
* Linters
