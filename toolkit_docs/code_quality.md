# Code quality

**Having a good deployment pipeline with tests**

**Resources**

Code quality can be measured by online software services like the following (add an integration to one of the softwares and add a badge):
* [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)
* [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/)
* [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/)

Code coverage is measuring how much of your code is tested and can be measured by using something like Coveralls.
Build checks can be done using the following:
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
* [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/)
* [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/)
* [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)
