# code-gov-repo-template
A basic template to use for all code.gov repositories which includes our standard documents and contact info. Using this as a base ensures that all of our community standards are followed.


## Project Name:
Your project’s name is the first thing people will see upon scrolling down to your README, and is included upon creation of your README file.

## Description:
A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

## Table of Contents: 
Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

## Installation: 
Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

## Usage:
The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Contributing:
Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work.

## License: 
Finally, include a section for the license of your project.
